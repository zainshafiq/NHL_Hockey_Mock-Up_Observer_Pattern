# NHL_Mock-Up_Observer_Pattern
NHL Game Mock-Up Observer Pattern, ENSE 470 U of R Lab

Look on URCourses and you will ﬁnd a sample application. This application is the prototype for a NHL application. Currently it supports 6 teams and will allow creating games for that day and updating the game scores.

Given the existing application, the objective is to adapt it to provide notiﬁcations to an interested user. The way to do this is to modify the code and integrate it into the observer design pattern.

Given the existing Java source code given, modify it to allow users to be notiﬁed when a score updates. This notiﬁcation will be given to any user that subscribes to certain teams.
